I am conservation biologist based in Switzerland, where I work as a postdoctoral researcher at the [Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL](https://www.wsl.ch).

I have a wide range of experience in conservation projects and biodiversity research spanning 4 continents.

A good knowledge of trends in species patterns underpins successful conservation activities; it is important to know where species are declining so that conservation management can be implemented. Additionally, species monitoring is essential to assess whether conservation actions have beneficial effects for biodiversity.

As such, my academic research mostly focusses upon developing and improving the ways in which species can be monitored at large scales. I am particularly interested in evaluating how effectively new techniques (e.g. environmental DNA, remote sensing, citizen science) can provide information that can support conservation management.
 
Since being astounded by the amazing diversity of species within the Amazon, I have had a particular interest in amphibian species, and they have been the focus of most of my conservation and research activities in the past decade. 


**I am currently in search of a new position; I am interested in opportunities for ecological research, or within a non-academic conservation oriented organisation.**
